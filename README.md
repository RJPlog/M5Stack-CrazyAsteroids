# M5Stack-CrazyAsteroids
Simple game to check M5Stack's and my skills

I started my first programming experience with a C64 in the early 1980ies. I always had the dream to program a little game, but I never managed in my youth. 
Recently I started thinking about to teach my children something about programming, and a colleague recommended the M5Stack to me. So I started to do some exercises. Even if my children are not very interested in programming the at last played this game a little while.
Now I am interested in learning something about github, so I will use this as a project to do some further exercises.

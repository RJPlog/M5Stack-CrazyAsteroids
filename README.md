I started my first programming experience with a C64 in the early 1980ies. I always had the dream to program a little game, but I never managed in my youth. 
Recently I started thinking about to teach my children something about programming, and a colleague recommended the M5Stack to me. So I started to do some exercises. Even if my children are not very interested in programming now, at least they played this game with some fun.
Now I am interested in learning something about github, so I will use this as a project to do some further exercises.

Here some stuff (only for me) to remember the necessary steps for changes:
- open terminal
- change to directory of Crazy_Asteroids
- cd C:\Users....\Crazy_Asteroid
- git pull  // download the acutal files from github
- make your changes
- git add .
- git commit -m "message"
- git push  // local changes will be uploaded
